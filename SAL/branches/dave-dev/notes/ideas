=====

- all responses are streaming by default until a response tagged with isFinalResponse comes through
  - means we can subscribe/unsubscribe to a sensor list and it'll keep up to date in the background
    instead of having to poll for the list

- probably for (much) later on
  - need some form of addressing
    - [SAL address][No-recurse char][Separator][Sensor address][Command address]
    - can address a single SAL instance, or a single SAL instance plus all of its children
      - that's what no-recurse is for
    - should be able to aliases for addresses
      - 'this' for the local SAL - not sure if that's with or without recursion
    - SAL commands go to SAL addresses
    - Sensor commands go to SAL+Sensor addresses
    - Commands that make use of the outputs of other commands will have a command address in there arguments
      - to connect the results of a sensor stream to some kind of data sink for instance

- server runs with either config file or command line options
  - supported communications types and config for those
  - whether or not to have a local client
    - the type of gui to use for the local client
