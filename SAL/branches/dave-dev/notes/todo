TODO
====

Ongoing
-------

- Keep the worklog up to date
- When a logical unit of code is completed
  - Javadoc it
  - unit test it
- Checkin regularly

Overall List
------------

- write client / server binary protocol code with mina and test

- create client / server interfaces and code
  - Server will need a list of ServerCommManagers, one for each type of supported transport
    - swing can set up the list (as well as the transports it contains)

- get XML stuff working
   - might have to create different root element types for different documents
   - Giles seems to have various constraints he's imposing on the config files
- write XML tests for marshalling / unmarshalling and validation

- separate the UI from the client
- use command pattern to clean up the client side commands

- review events / sensors / protocols etc...
  - attempt to make sensors / protocols pluggable 

- possibly use ANTLR for a friendlier command line interface with the current one supported as the hotkeys

- second version of DirectoryClassLoader
  - see class header comments for notes

Short Term List
---------------

- write tcp binary codec
  - use strings throughout if there's no description
  - otherwise pack down the types
  - needs the ability to request the description when receiving an unfamiliar type
    - a cache would be pretty handy here
    - modification times might be useful as well in case someone updates a description

- throw an exception if we create a particular message from a message with a different name

- add exception handling and logging support to the comms code
- javadoc comms code

- write xml helpers
- add unit tests for xml helpers
- javadoc for any xml helpers

- add unit tests for plugin code
- javadoc plugin code

Today
-----

- get message validation written and tested

- write and test the binary protocol 
  - string based one first
  - then the one based on descriptions

- finish off xml helpers / classes for configuration files and write tests
- javadoc everything
  - except plugin (wait until new version)
- start writing SAL command factories
