TODO
====

Ongoing
-------

- Keep the worklog up to date
- When a logical unit of code is completed
  - Javadoc it
  - unit test it
- Checkin regularly

Overall List
------------

- get XML stuff working
   - might have to create different root element types for different documents
   - Giles seems to have various constraints he's imposing on the config files
- write XML tests for marshalling / unmarshalling and validation

- maybe add an 'xml' type to the schema

- create client / server interfaces and code
  - ServerComm and ClientComm interfaces 
    - use DI to set Comm objects in generic Client and Server code
    - local connection implements both
    - will need a list of supported Comm objects at the server side, have to handle them all
  - Higher level communications interface
    - gives a domain specific comms api per subclass
    - the object -> message translation is transport dependent, so makes sense

- write client / server mock objects for testing

- write client / server binary protocol code with mina and test
- write client / server xml rpc code with mina and test
- ? write client / server rest code with mina and test ?

- separate the UI from the client
- use command pattern to clean up the client side commands

- review events / sensors / protocols etc...
  - attempt to make sensors / protocols pluggable 

- possibly use ANTLR for a friendlier command line interface with the current one supported as the hotkeys

- second version of DirectoryClassLoader
  - see class header comments for notes

Short Term List
---------------

- write xml helpers
- add unit tests for xml helpers
- javadoc for any xml helpers

- write and informally test transport code for local, tcp.binary and tcp.xml
- write mock objects for comms code (high level and comms specific)
- write unit tests for comms code
- javadoc comms code

- add unit tests for plugin code
- javadoc plugin code

Today
-----

- get xml codec written and tested
- get tcp transport written and tested
- get binary codec written and tested (using strings for all data for now)
- get message validation written and tested
- finish off xml helpers / classes for configuration files and write tests
- javadoc everything
  - except plugin (wait until new version)
- start writing SAL command factories
