TODO
====

Ongoing
-------

- Keep the worklog up to date
- When a logical unit of code is completed
  - Javadoc it
  - unit test it
- Checkin regularly

Overall List
------------

- create client / server interfaces and code
  - Server will need a list of ServerCommManagers, one for each type of supported transport
    - swing can set up the list (as well as the transports it contains)

- get XML stuff working
   - might have to create different root element types for different documents
   - Giles seems to have various constraints he's imposing on the config files
- write XML tests for marshalling / unmarshalling and validation

- separate the UI from the client
- use command pattern to clean up the client side commands

- review events / sensors / protocols etc...
  - attempt to make sensors / protocols pluggable 

- possibly use ANTLR for a friendlier command line interface with the current one supported as the hotkeys

- second version of DirectoryClassLoader
  - see class header comments for notes

- look at ActiveMQ / Camel and/or JMS to manage messages
  - means it's someone elses problem
  - probably good to have some experience with it
  - might be an easier integration point with dataturbine etc...

Short Term List
---------------

- for tcp binary codec
  - needs the ability to request the description when receiving an unfamiliar type
    - a cache would be pretty handy here
    - modification times might be useful as well in case someone updates a description
  - might consider a pure binary form of the protocol later on

- add exception handling and logging support to the comms code
- javadoc comms code

- write xml helpers
- add unit tests for xml helpers
- javadoc for any xml helpers

- add unit tests for plugin code
- javadoc plugin code

Today
-----

- get message validation tested

- test client / server code over multiple machines

- change grow factory to use a hashmap of names / descriptions for description retrieval
  - potential spin off into a base class with convinience method to load descriptions from a directory
    - possibly even from a resource path

- finish off xml helpers / classes for configuration files and write tests
- javadoc everything
  - except plugin (wait until new version)
- start writing SAL command factories
