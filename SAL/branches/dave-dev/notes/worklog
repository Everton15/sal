=======

10/12/08

- created a basic directory layout and pom file
- began adding the exisitng dependencies
- created an XML schema for the config files

11/12/08
- resolved JAXB dependency conflict
- began work on plugin code
  - investigated the Java Plugin Framework (JPF) 
    - looks a bit strange
  - splashed around a little, rapidly prototyped a few ideas that didn't stick
    - got to the point that it's starting to look alright
  - need to finish the updating and jar loading code
  - need to write tests

12/12/08
- finished code work on plugin classloader
  - got jar loading working
    - can't have jars within jars without a custom class loader
    - that's less craziness to handle == good thing
    - was just calling one read() of the JarInputStream 
      - doesn't always read everything in the one call
      - easily fixed after taking a while to diagnose
  - got name resolution happening
  - got dependencies working by lazy loading the classes
    - prior to this things were freaking out 
    - loading the classes as listed in a jar means you'll miss some dependency ordering
  - got updates working by making a child class loader per file
    - uses parent delegation to lazy load dependencies
    - means we can remove or update class definitions per file
  - got removal working by getting names into an array and iterating over them
  - add method to get the names of the concrete class that implement a particular interface
- still have unit testing and javadoc to complete

22/12/08
- created the basics of the communications classes

23/12/08
- more work on the communications classes
  - made an xml schema for commands / responses
  - pretty similar to Gilles' version, but with the inherent streaming 
    rather than callbacks
  - ready to play with Mina
    - main task will be serializing commands / responses to bytes

05/01/09 & 06/01/09
- got the command and response types sorted out
  - added unit tests for the round tripping to/from xml
- got the following working and tested
  - CommandProcessor
  - ClientCommsManager
  - ServerCommsManager
  - LocalTransport
- to do this, created a set of commands and responses and the associated 
  listeners and factories
- started work on the XML codec for the TCP transport

07/01/09
- made some changes to the ServerCommsManager and ServerTransport classes
- got the TCP transport, XML codec and string-based portion of the binary codec working and tested
- refactored the code to merge the Command and Response types into a Message type
- started on the MessageDescription handling with a view to working on the validation code
